# Image-Classification-and-Uncertainty-Estimation
As in the CNN for HiTS repository, we will work with data obtained by the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS), however, this work will be mainly directed at estimating uncertainty in predictions using methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout, in addition to model calibration. where we apply Sigmoid regression


It is important to say that the HITS data was provided by Dr. Guillermo Cabrera Vives.
